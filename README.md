# Browser Extension Manager UI

This project is a **browser extension manager dashboard** built with **React.js** and **Next.js**. It was created as a personal learning project to practice modern React (with hooks and functional components) and to complete a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes.
- **Extension Management**: View, activate/deactivate, and remove browser extensions.
